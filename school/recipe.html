    <p id="step1"><b>Step 1</b><br>In a small bowl, stir the yeast and Â½ tablespoon sugar into warmed water until dissolved. Let it sit until it's foamy for about 7-10 minutes.vIn a large bowl, add the flour, garlic powder, salt, and remaining sugar. Now whisk to combine well. Add the activated yeast to the bowl along with the olive oil. Mix until all ingredients are well combined and form a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a couple of tablespoons of flour.</p>
    <p id="step2"><b>Step 2</b><br>Form the dough into a ball and place back in the bowl (*lightly dust bowl with flour before placing the dough ball in). Completely cover the bowl with a damp napkin or hand towel for 30 minutes or until dough doubles in size
        Place a large piece of parchment paper over your work area (about the size of your pan).
        Dust the paper with flour so you can spread your dough easily. Cut the dough in half using a wet knife.</p>
    <p id="step3"><b>Step 3</b><br>Using your hands, spread dough across the parchment paper into a round pizza shape to your desired thickness. I spread the dough pretty thin because it rises while cooking. The edges should be slightly thicker to form a pillowed crust.
        Season your crust by lightly brushing with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and Italian herbs. Now, spread the sauce evenly with a spoon over the pizza and top with Vegan Mozzarella.
